# Diff Toggle

Diff Toggle is a Vim plugin to speed up editing diff files. When enabled
`<Space>` will toggle the first character of the current line between `+`, `-`
and space characters in diff files.

What is this useful for you ask? Try use it next time you are adding files to
Git with `git add --edit`.
